# Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„
My solutions for the Advent of Code 2021 written in Kotlin.

This repo is based my [Kotlin template for AoC](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-kotlin-template)

## Logbook
###  Day 1
Let's begin :-)  
First I followed a plan of giving `fold` a try but was bummed that I only got the acc and not to values to compare with each other. Therefore, I had to handle list indices. Solved it though. Cleaned it up with some extension functions and without using fold, but rather with list transforms.
