# Advent of Code 2021 ðŸŽ„
My solutions for the Advent of Code 2021 written in Kotlin.

This repo is based my [Kotlin template for AoC](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-kotlin-template)

## Logbook
###  [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day01/Day01SonarSweep.kt)
Let's begin :-)  
First I followed a plan of giving `fold` a try but was bummed that I only got the acc and not two values to compare with each other. Therefore, I had to handle list indices. Solved it though. Cleaned it up with some extension functions and without using fold, but rather with list transforms.

After looking at other solutions I learned about the `.windowed` function and implemented an alternative solution with it. 

###  [Day 2: Dive](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day02/Day02Dive.kt)
I wanted to solve it only by transforming the input data without creating variables. It was a challenge but it worked quite well. I introduced two classes for the second part to make it more readable.

###  [Day 3: Binary Diagnostic](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day03/Day03BinaryDiagnostic.kt)
Wow, that was harder than I expected. I took forever for that `.transpose()` function and regretted for the first time not using Python.  
For part 2 I could hone my rusty recursion skills which I only used at AoC outside of university.
I think I should come back to this problem and work on a simpler and cleaner solution.

###  [Day 4: Giant Squid](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day04/Day04GiantSquid.kt) / [Tests](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day04/Day04Test.kt)
Nothing special on this day. I tried to write clean and tested code. I am quite happy with the results and even worked test driven for some parts.   
The previous days prepared me well for writing the winning conditions which were quite fun to write. I also wrote one for diagonals which I later discovered were unnecessary. 

###  [Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day05/Day05HydrothermalVenture.kt) / [Tests](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day05/Day05Test.kt)
Again pretty straight forward today. I used a list of mutable lists to count the vents. I like how the extension functions make it very easy to read what's happening in the solve functions.

###  [Day 6: Lanternfish](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day06/Day06Lanternfish.kt)
My naive approach for part 1 could heat up the room pretty good for part 2.

###  [Day 7: The Treachery of Whales](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day07/Day07TheTreacheryOfWhales.kt)
Pretty happy with this one since it only took me only a few minutes and both tests were green on the first try, such a rare sight.  
I wonder if I there is a sigma operand for the second calculation, I feel like there should be one.   
Also, the runtime is pretty slow since it's a brute force approach. ~~But right now I don't feel like optimizing.~~ Found the trick with the triangle numbers. Which reduced the runtime from 5s to 100ms, not using higher order function reduced it further to 30ms.

###  [Day 8: Seven Segment Search](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day08/Day08SevenSegmentSearch.kt) / [Much cleaner solution](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day08/Day08WithoutAnalyzingIndividualSegments.kt)
I struggled with this one. I chose the wrong datatype to store my remaining candidates for each segment. I used an array of strings and for the operations I used char arrays. Here I got hugely confused with Kotlin's Array<Char> and CharArray. Afterwards I read the docs and am wiser now :)
I refactored my solution now that it is easier to read and more concise but it is still my original logic. I would like to implement it again using sets because I think that's way more appropriate. Also would like to test out a solution of a colleague who didn't decode the pattern but immediately determined the value of the codes.

Great and interesting day!

// edit:  
Tried it again using a map and the approach of my colleague not to decode each segment by itself but rather the numbers as a whole. SO. MUCH. EASIER!

###  [Day 9: Smoke Basin](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day09/Day09SmokeBasin.kt)
Simple solution with a queue.

###  [Day 10: Syntax Scoring](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day10/Day10SyntaxScoring.kt) / [Tests](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day10/Day10Test.kt)
Solved this one with my colleague using Ping-Pong-TDD-Pair-Programming. Great practice and lots of fun :)

###  [Day 11: Dumbo Octopus](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day11/Day11DumboOctopus.kt)
Nothing special today. I like the solution of putting the octopus in a map with the coordinates as a key. Makes finding the neighbours pretty easy and you don't have to check for limits of the map. Since each octopus knows it's neighbours, I don't need to remember their position of the map which is nice too.

###  [Day 12: Passage Pathing](https://github.com/henningBunk/advent-of-code-2021/blob/main/app/src/y2021/day12/Day12PassagePathing.kt)
